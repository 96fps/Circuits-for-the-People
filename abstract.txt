		Stored Structures
		 {

	---
	 Circuit_Sim
	 ===
		tick()
			- propagate across metal, vias, and open silicon paths.
			- update transistors' blocking/open states


	---
	 Circuit_Draw
	 ===
		draw silicon layer
			draw silicon
			draw transistors

		draw metal layer
			draw metal
			draw vias

		<draw power propogation>


	---
	 Lattice_grid
	 ===
 		- store multi-material structures
 		- draw multi-material structures
 		- test for connections


 	---
 	 abstract circuit
 	 ===
 		- the connections between inputs, transistors, and outputs are cached so simulations don't have to simulate ever tile on a wire every time a tick occurs.
